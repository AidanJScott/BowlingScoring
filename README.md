# BowlingScoring
Creator: Aidan Scott

I created this project to implement object oriented programming in Python. 
I made a project that included inheritence and composition with objects in order
to display a working knowledge of the two concepts. The ASCII display was not my focus, 
but I am proud of how the scorecard turned out. 

Enjoy!
